# Higher-Order Strategies

A _higher-order strategy_ is a strategy which is generated by another
strategy. That sounds kind of scary, so let's consider an example first.

Say you have a function you want to test that takes a slice and an index
into that slice. If we use a fixed size for the slice, it's easy, but maybe
we need to test with different slice sizes. We could try something with a
filter:

```rust
# extern crate proptest;
use proptest::prelude::*;
fn some_function(stuff: &[String], index: usize) { /* do stuff */ }

proptest! {
    #[test]
    # fn dummy(0..1) {} // Doctests don't build `#[test]` functions, so we need this
    fn test_some_function(
        stuff in prop::collection::vec(".*", 1..100),
        index in 0..100usize
    ) {
        prop_assume!(index < stuff.len());
        some_function(&stuff, index);
    }
}
```

This doesn't work very well. First off, you get a lot of global rejections
since `index` will be outside of `stuff` 50% of the time. But secondly, it
will be rare to actually get a small `stuff` vector, since it would have to
randomly choose a small `index` at the same time.

The solution is the `prop_flat_map` combinator. This is sort of like
`prop_map`, except that the transform returns a _strategy_ instead of a
value. This is more easily understood by implementing our example:

```rust
# extern crate proptest;
use proptest::prelude::*;

fn some_function(stuff: Vec<String>, index: usize) {
    let _ = &stuff[index];
    // Do stuff
}

fn vec_and_index() -> impl Strategy<Value = (Vec<String>, usize)> {
    prop::collection::vec(".*", 1..100)
        .prop_flat_map(|vec| {
            let len = vec.len();
            (Just(vec), 0..len)
        })
}

proptest! {
    #[test]
    # fn dummy(0..1) {} // Doctests don't build `#[test]` functions, so we need this
    fn test_some_function((vec, index) in vec_and_index()) {
        some_function(vec, index);
    }
}
# fn main() { test_some_function(); }
```

In `vec_and_index()`, we make a strategy to produce an arbitrary vector.
But then we derive a new strategy based on _values_ produced by the first
one. The new strategy produces the generated vector unchanged, but also
adds a valid index into that vector, which we can do by picking the
strategy for that index based on the size of the vector.

Even though the new strategy specifies the singleton `Just(vec)` strategy
for the vector, proptest still understands the connection to the original
strategy and will shrink `vec` as well. All the while, `index` continues to
be a valid index into `vec`.

`prop_compose!` actually allows making second-order strategies like this by
simply providing three argument lists instead of two. The below desugars to
something much like what we wrote by hand above, except that the index and
vector's positions are internally reversed due to borrowing limitations.

```rust
# extern crate proptest;
# use proptest::prelude::*;
prop_compose! {
    fn vec_and_index()(vec in prop::collection::vec(".*", 1..100))
                    (index in 0..vec.len(), vec in Just(vec))
                    -> (Vec<String>, usize) {
       (vec, index)
   }
}
```
